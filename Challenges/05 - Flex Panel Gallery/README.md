# Day 5 - Flex Panel Gallery
After a draining array cardio for Day 4, it was restoring to have a challenge where the focus isn't entirely on JavaScript. This exercise leaned heavily on CSS, particularly Flexbox and transitions, to create a panel photo gallery.

#### My Twist
While I didn't have the time today, I hope to go back and alter the design/words in a way that is meaningful to me. I would also love to refactor the script code so it checks if a panel is already open, and if so - closes it, before opening a new one.

## Takeaways

#### ```.toggle()``` Method
While it always seems to slip my mind when I need it the most, the ```.toggle()``` method is a great way to switch between two different classes. A common use of this method is when determining whether to hide or show an element.

#### ```.includes()``` Method
There was a brief mention of this method in Day 4's exercise to see if the boulevards in Paris had 'de' in them, but it wasn't fully explained. In this exercise, we saw the true power in how this method can uncover if one string is inside another. You can also find a very cute explanation of this method on [Alligator.io](https://alligator.io/js/includes-string-method/).

## Challenges
Just when I think I've mastered CSS, a challenge like this comes along and reminds me that there's _so many_ facets of CSS that I have yet to explore. For those looking for more practice with Flexbox, an easy and fun way to learn the commands is to play [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/).
